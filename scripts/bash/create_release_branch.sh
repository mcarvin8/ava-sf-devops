# Script: create_release_branch.sh
# Description: Creates or updates a release branch by merging multiple story 
#              branches and combining their package.xml manifests. Prevents 
#              merging into protected branches (main, fullqa, develop, ContPar).
# Usage: 
#   RELEASE_BRANCH=release/1.2.3 STORY_BRANCHES="story/123 story/456" ./create_release_branch.sh
# Environment Variables Required:
#   - RELEASE_BRANCH: Name of the release branch to create/update
#   - STORY_BRANCHES: Space or comma-separated list of story branches to merge
#   - MAINTAINER_PAT_NAME, MAINTAINER_PAT_VALUE
